# Kaggle Challenges with Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster :ship: :ocaen:


# About 
## The Project 
- This project was one of the required projects in Data Science Immersive Course provided by [General Assembly](https://www.linkedin.com/company/general-assembly-middle-east/).
- The aim of the project is to creating and iteratively refining a classification model to **Predict survival on the Titanic**.
- Using Kaggle to practice the modeling process and document findings on Kaggle Kernels.
- Learn from community resources on the platform and collaborate with a physical team.

#### The Data Science Process That Must Covered 
- Problem Statement
- Data Cleaning and EDA
- Preprocessing and Modeling
- Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding
- Conclusion and Recommendations
- Organization and Professionalism
- Visualizations
- Python Syntax and Control Flow

## The Dataset 
The dataset available at [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) in kaggle.
